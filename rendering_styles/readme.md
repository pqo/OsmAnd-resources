Rendering styles
================
**Default (general purposes):**
* **default.render.xml :** <br>General purpose style. Simplified rendering to have cleaner maps in the populated cities. Key features: contour lines, routes, surface quality, access restrictions, road shields, paths rendering according to SAC scale, whitewater sports features.
* **Touring-view_(more-contrast-and-details).render.xml :** <br>General purpose style: High-detail, high-contrast map for travelers and professional drivers. Provides at any given map zoom the maximum amount of travel details available, in particular depicts all roads, tracks, paths, and unambiguously distinguishes their types. Also features outdoor touring options like the original SAC Alpine hiking trail coding. (Depends on default.)
* **topo.render.xml :** <br>Contrast style designed primarily for nature hiking, trekking, and cycling. Good readability in complex external lighting. Key features: contrast roads and natural objects, different types of routes, contour lines with advanced settings, more details at corresponding zoom levels than "default" style. "Surface integrity" option allows you distinguish between roads with different surface quality. No night mode. (Standalone.)
* **LightRS.render.xml :** <br>Simple and contrast style for car navigation. Gentle for the eyes in the night mode. Key features: contour lines, contrast orange styled roads, less distracting secondary map objects. (Standalone.)
* **offroad.render.xml :** <br>Suitable for use during off-road driving. Suitable for use with green satellite images as an undarlay map. Key points: reduced thickness of the main roads, increased thickness of tracks, paths, bicycle and other routes. Based on Topo style.

**Special:**
* **skimap.render.xml :** <br>Style for skiing. Key features: renders pistes, aerial ways and other ski features in a convenient way. Less distracting secondary map objects. (Android/iOS, depends on default.)
* **nautical.render.xml :** <br>Style for marine and river navigation. Key features: buoys, lighthouses, water navigation lines and marks, harbours, seamark services, depth contours. (Android/iOS, depends on default.) 
* **stormchasing.render.xml :** <br>Style for storm chasing. Key features: Paved roads are rendered in bright colors for daytime readability. Roads with low surface integrity (gravel, dirt) are rendered in gray color across zoom levels and road types. Primary, secondary, and tertiary road types are all rendered starting at the same zoom level to quickly identify fast navigation routes. Local road types are rendered at the next zoom level for close range interception. Roads without surface integrity information are easily identified by a hollow rendering style to encourage user contributions to the underlying OSM data. (tested on Android, depends on LightRS.) 

**Examples and deprecated:**
* **standalone-template.render.xml :** Template for a standalone style.
* **mapnik.render.xml :** <br>Old mapnik-style default rendering style. Key features: colours are similar to Mapnik style. (Depends on default.)
* **regions.render.xml**
* **Topo-map-assimilation.render.xml**
* **UniRS.render.xml**
